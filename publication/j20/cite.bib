abstract = {Buildings are the main energy consumers in cities, and accurately assessing their energy usage is crucial for improving their operational energy efficiency. However, conventional building energy simulation tools use a homogeneous Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather file, ignoring inter-city microclimate variation. This study aims to develop a spatial prediction model for microclimate conditions by considering the impacts of urban morphology. A multi-layer urban morphological mapping approach is developed to describe the urban morphologies graphically. The proposed multi-modal ensemble deep learning (DL) model predicts microclimate conditions using both microclimate data and morphological maps. The ensemble model outperforms individual multi-modal DL models trained on microclimate data from a single weather station. A validation experiment was conducted on a university campus using local weather stations. The proposed model reduces air temperature prediction errors by 78.1 %, 24.5 %, 19.4 %, 13.2 %, and 8.9 %, compared to TMY data, Kriging model, DL model, Factor-based DL model, and Map-based DL model, respectively. For relative humidity, the error reductions are 81.6 %, 32.6 %, 22.3 %, 29.8 %, and 10.9 %, respectively. The proposed method can be used to estimate microclimate conditions at the urban scale and provide more accurate weather data for urban building energy simulation.}
