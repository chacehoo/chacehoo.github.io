      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to share that our recent review article &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032120305372?via%3Dihub&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Neighborhood-level coordination and negotiation techniques for managing demand-side flexibility in residential microgrids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was published in &lt;em&gt;Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews&lt;/em&gt;. Glad to see my last piece of work at PolyU coming out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residential microgrid is a dynamic and complex cyber-physical system, which consists of multiple cooperative, non-cooperative and even conflicting entities. Harmonised coordination, not merely unorganised cooperation, among cooperative entities and negotiation among non-cooperative entities based on information sharing are needed to achieve the neighbourhood-level optimal solutions in a residential microgrid. Typical architectures for coordination and negotiation are classified into centralised, decentralised, hierarchical distributed, and non-hierarchical distributed architecture. Major coordination and negotiation techniques, including multi-agent system, optimisation and game theory, are reviewed and summarised.&lt;/p&gt;
