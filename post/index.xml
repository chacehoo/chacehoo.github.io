      <title>May 2025 | Dr. Hu visited Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate at E.ON Energy Research Center, RWTH Aachen University.</title>
      <link>https://maomaohu.net/post/post_46_visit/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://maomaohu.net/post/post_46_visit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Dr. Maomao Hu visited the

      <title>May 2025 | New paper entitled &#34;Public sentiment analysis of data center energy consumption using social media data and large language models&#34; was published in *Energy and buildings*.</title>
      <link>https://maomaohu.net/post/post_45_paper/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://maomaohu.net/post/post_45_paper/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The full paper can be found 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2025.115802&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data centers play a crucial role in the modern digital industry, but their significant energy consumption, representing about 1.3% of global annual electricity use in 2023, poses a persistent challenge to sustainable development. While extensive research has focused on improving data center energy efficiency through technological innovations, the roles of governmental, social, economic, and legal contributions remain underexplored. Understanding public sentiment can help stakeholders develop holistic strategies that go beyond technology. Traditional survey-based public sentiment analyses are often time-consuming and labor-intensive with limited representativeness and dynamic scope due to small sample size, short durations, and spatial constraints. Research using social media data (SMD) addresses these limitations but faces challenges such as the need for extensive annotated datasets for training and a lack of accuracy or granularity in topic classification. In this study, we aim to develop a holistic approach to analyzing public sentiment and topics related to data center energy consumption using SMD and large language models (LLMs). We collected and preprocessed 104,624 pieces of SMD from Twitter, focusing on data center energy consumption in the USA. Sentiment labels were assigned using three LLMs, with majority voting employed to reduce individual LLM bias and identify the model with the highest F-score (0.953), Gemma 2, for subsequent topic classification. We observed an 87.4% increase in public attention to data center energy consumption in Q4 2022 and identified a predominant shift in sentiment from positive to negative, correlated with average electricity prices in US cities. We proposed a region-specific, three-tier public topic framework to analyze public topic distribution and temporal trends, resulting in four targeted policy recommendations focused on society, economy, and environment (SEE), renewable energy utilization, data center site selection, and economic factors. This study extends insights beyond technical aspects to promote sustainable energy efficiency in data center development and introduces a transferable approach applicable to public sentiment and topic analysis in other regions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>July 2023 | New paper entitled &#34;Empirical Exploration of Zone-by-zone Energy Flexibility - a Non-intrusive Load Disaggregation Approach for Commercial Buildings&#34; was published in *Energy and buildings*.</title>
      <link>https://maomaohu.net/post/post_21_paper/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://maomaohu.net/post/post_21_paper/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The full paper can be found 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113339&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited to share our latest research on empirical exploration of zone-by-zone energy flexibility in commercial buildings. Coauthored with Jacques de Chalendar and Ram Rajagopal, our study combines repetitive demand response experimentation in multiple buildings with an experimental-data-driven non-intrusive load disaggregation approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core idea revolves around developing a ‘virtual’ zonal power meter, providing high-granular insights into room-level energy use and energy flexibility, backed by real-world experimental data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the key findings, we discovered that a small number of rooms accounted for a significant portion of energy use and energy flexibility, and surprisingly, the most energy-intensive rooms were not necessarily the most energy-flexible ones. For the three tested buildings, the top 30% of most energy-flexible zones provided around 80% of the total energy flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools we developed are poised to empower electric grid or district energy system operators to view the controlled energy-flexible entities as a fleet of zones rather than a fleet of buildings, unlocking the potential for targeted demand flexibility strategies that balance zone-by-zone energy reduction with zone-by-zone costs to occupants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does Building X have higher forecast accuracy than Building Y? What is the major factor contributing to the high forecast accuracy of Building X? DATA or ALGORITHMS? Regarding DATA, what building load characteristics affect the forecast accuracy and how can we quantify this influential factor? Regarding ALGORITHMS, what algorithms are more likely to outperform others in the field of building load forecasting? Do deep learning models outperform conventional &amp;ldquo;shallow&amp;rdquo; machine learning models? What model is the feasible model for benchmarking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To shed some light on these questions and improve the RELIABILITY and INTERPRETABILITY of ML techniques, we examined the impacts of building load dispersion level on its best load forecasting accuracy. This was accomplished by comparing the performances of 11 different prediction models, including “shallow” machine learning and deep learning techniques, over 9 weeks of operation for 56 British non-domestic buildings. Two key takeaways are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each building has its best achievable forecasting performance and most importantly, it is largely influenced by its load dispersion level. In our study, we proposed novel metrics to quantify the dispersion level of building intraday load profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not a panacea-like individual model for all building load forecasting problems. A complex model structure does not guarantee a higher forecasting performance. We find that conventional “shallow” ML models still outperform the increasingly popular deep learning models for time-series load forecasting. We also demonstrate that the naive persistent model is not naive at all after a long period of testing and it is recommended to be used as the benchmarking model in the building load forecasting problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrilled to see my last piece of work at Oxford finally coming out. Many thanks to our co-authors without whom it would not be possible to put together this work: Bruce Stephen, Jethro Browell, Stephen Haben, and David Wallom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraging the flexibility of static batteries and residential flexible loads is an effective way to reduce the impacts of intermittent renewable energy power generation on the utility grid. However, there is lack of proper operation strategies to manage these distributed energy resources. To address this problem, a novel forecasting and flexibility-based operation strategy was proposed for the photovoltaic-battery-flexible loads (PV-battery-FL) system of a single household. Compared with the traditional maximizing self-consumption and time-of-use strategies, the proposed strategy fully harnesses the flexibility of batteries and residential flexible loads, and is more grid-friendliness to the utility grid. To assess the performance of the PV-battery-FL system under the proposed strategy, a comprehensive evaluation framework was developed considering the economic and environmental performance, PV self-consumption, zero energy potential, and impacts on the utility grid. The effectiveness of the forecasting and flexibility-based strategy was validated by case studies given various scenarios. Results indicate that the proposed strategy performs better than the maximizing self-consumption and time-of-use strategies. Especially, the average ramping index reduction ratio of the forecasting and flexibility-based strategy was improved by 105.1% and 60.9%; the maximum power fed into the utility grid was decreased by 50.3%, compared with the maximizing self-consumption and time-of-use strategies for the PV-battery-FL system. When the feed-in limitation exists, the forecasting and flexibility-based strategy can also reduce the cut-off energy significantly. This study can provide guidance for the demand-side management of the battery and flexible loads of residential PV-battery-FL systems in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Split-type air conditioners (ACs) are the major contributors to the total electricity use and peak power demand in residential buildings due to their high penetration. Accurate prediction of their energy consumption plays a significant role in demand side management (DSM), because it can help exploit the demand response (DR) potential
of these ACs fully. However, the existing studies on the load characteristics modelling of split-type ACs are still not comprehensive, especially in the consideration of occupant behavior and appliance characteristics. To solve this problem, this study has developed a novel flexible load characteristics model by combining the stochastic method, grey-box modelling (i.e., equivalent thermal parameter (ETP) model) and random forest method. The stochastic method can help capture the dynamic occupants’ energy-related behaviors considering various family structures. Random forest can address the difficulties in simulating the power characteristics of variable-speed ACs under various operating conditions. With the prediction error of 2.8%, the proposed model can effectively characterize the energy performance of split-type ACs at both individual and aggregate levels. To better show the load flexibility of ACs, an investigation on DR potential of split-type ACs was also carried out by resetting temperature setpoints. The result showed that the maximum DR potentials at the scope of 1000 aggregated households are 394.54 kWh and 323.82 kWh on weekdays and weekends, respectively. The developed flexible load characteristics model of ACs can be used by utility companies for DR potential assessment and model-based DR control for a single household or building clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s building and urban energy systems are not only energy-intensive but also data-intensive due to the advances in information and communications technology. How can we extract actionable information and knowledge from large volumes of operational data using advanced data analytics? More importantly, how can the extracted information be further used for data-driven modelling (grey/black-box) and advanced model-based control to make building and urban energy systems low-carbon, energy-efficient, energy-flexible, and resilient against climate-induced extreme weather events? This talk aims to unpack these questions and spark reflection on the topic of data analytics-based techniques for building and urban energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning techniques are increasingly applied in building electrical load analysis thanks to the enrichment of information-intensive sensory data. However, uncertainty is seldom considered among existing deep learning models. This study proposes three Bayesian deep neural network models for probabilistic building electrical load forecasting. Three prevalent deep neural networks (recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU)) are utilized for model development. In each model, the dropout technique is implemented as a variational Bayesian approximation to quantify two types of model uncertainties: aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Performances of the proposed models are evaluated using real data. The results showed that all the proposed three models achieved satisfactory performances and the Bayesian LSTM (BLSTM) model achieved the best performance with up to 15.4% mean absolute percentage error reduction than the baseline model. It was also found that the weather variables were not necessary inputs for Bayesian deep neural network models. The impacts of the input time lags and forecasting horizons on load forecasting accuracies were also investigated. It was found that the BLSTM model could derive decent model performances with only 10 h lagged electrical loads and achieve satisfactory accuracies for the 1-day ahead load forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load pattern categorization plays a significant role in enhancing the understanding of demand characteristics of different cohorts of energy customers on a distribution network. For a distribution network with embedded photovoltaic (PV) systems, it is also desirable to enumerate these premises since unreported PV installations can have a detrimental impact on voltage control, frequency regulation, and incur reverse power flows. In this paper, a holistic smart meter data analytics approach is proposed for classifying and characterizing the intra-day load curves of PV and non-PV households. Unlike existing studies based on raw time-series data, a series of interpretable and discriminating global and peak-period features are first developed to extract the physical information of load patterns. A two-step feature-based clustering is then applied to classify the load profiles of PV and non-PV households. A post-clustering quantitative compositional analysis is developed to characterize the energy use variability and compositional changes for each household. The proposed PV household identification method allows network owners to identify the existence of PV installations in a particular area for voltage control and ancillary service provision. In the longer term, effective load pattern categorization and post-clustering characterization can help better understand demand characteristics of different cohorts of customers, network utilization, and network-level changes in load growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate building energy prediction is vital to develop optimal control strategies to enhance building energy efficiency and energy flexibility. In recent years, the data-driven approach based on machine learning algorithms has been widely adopted for building energy prediction due to the availability of massive data in building automation systems (BASs), which automatically collect and store real-time building operational data. For new buildings and most existing buildings without installing advanced BASs, there is a lack of sufficient data to train data-driven predictive models. Transfer learning is a promising method to develop accurate and reliable data-driven building energy prediction models with limited training data by taking advantage of the rich data/knowledge obtained from other buildings. Few studies focused on the influences of source building datasets, pre-training data volume, and training data volume on the performance of the transfer learning method. The present study aims to develop a transfer learning-based ANN model for one-hour ahead building energy prediction to fill this research gap. Around 400 non-residential buildings’ data from the open-source Building Genome Project are used to test the proposed method. Extensive analysis demonstrates that transfer learning can effectively improve the accuracy of BPNN-based building energy models for information-poor buildings with very limited training data. The most influential building features which influence the effectiveness of transfer learning are found to be building usage and industry. The research outcomes can provide guidance for implementation of transfer learning, especially in selecting appropriate source buildings and datasets for developing accurate building energy prediction models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aug 2020 | Our new paper entitled &#34;Neighborhood-level Coordination and Negotiation Techniques for Managing Demand-side Flexibility in Residential Microgrids&#34; was published in *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews*.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our recent review article entitled &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032120305372?via%3Dihub&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Neighborhood-level coordination and negotiation techniques for managing demand-side flexibility in residential microgrids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was published in &lt;em&gt;Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews&lt;/em&gt;. Glad to see my last piece of work at PolyU coming out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management of demand-side flexibility plays a key role in reliable integration of intermittent renewable energy sources into residential microgrids. Residential microgrid is a dynamic and complex cyber-physical system, which consists of multiple cooperative, non-cooperative and even conflicting entities. Random and separate demand-side management of the multiple entities may have detrimental effects on the grid reliability like the peak “rebound” issue and on the economic benefits for both utilities and consumers. Harmonized coordination, not merely unorganized cooperation, among cooperative entities and negotiation among non-cooperative entities based on information sharing are therefore needed to achieve the neighborhood-level optimal solutions in a residential microgrid. This paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-the-art classification, technologies, architectures, and techniques for neighborhood-level coordination and negotiation in residential microgrids. Various types of coordination and negotiation behaviors are first categorized. The technologies, i.e., demand-side flexible resources involved in coordination and negotiation, are then summarized and introduced, including flexible loads, storage, and distributed generations. The typical architectures for coordination and negotiation are then classified into centralized, decentralized, hierarchical distributed, and non-hierarchical distributed architecture. Last, the major coordination and negotiation techniques, including multi-agent system, optimization and game theory, are reviewed and summarized. The challenges and opportunities for each technique are identified and critically discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
