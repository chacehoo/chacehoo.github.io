For the three tested buildings, the top 30% of most energy-flexible zones provided around 80% of the total energy flexibility.\nThe tools we developed are poised to empower electric grid or district energy system operators to view the controlled energy-flexible entities as a fleet of zones rather than a fleet of buildings, unlocking the potential for targeted demand flexibility strategies that balance zone-by-zone energy reduction with zone-by-zone costs to occupants.\n","date":1689379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689379200,"objectID":"6d0cec1fd1ebfa9ce7f237c58da35ae1","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_21_paper/","publishdate":"2023-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_21_paper/","section":"post","summary":"Our recent research paper entitled \"**Empirical Exploration of Zone-by-zone Energy Flexibility - a Non-intrusive Load Disaggregation Approach for Commercial Buildings**\" was published in *Energy and Buildings*.","tags":null,"title":"July 2023 | New paper entitled \"Empirical Exploration of Zone-by-zone Energy Flexibility - a Non-intrusive Load Disaggregation Approach for Commercial Buildings\" was published in *Energy and buildings*.","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A talk was given to the Texas A\u0026amp;M University, College Station, TX, on \u0026ldquo;Decarbonization of Building and Urban Energy Systems: A Multiscale Data-driven Approach\u0026rdquo;.\n","date":1686009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686009600,"objectID":"495e11e1cea458ffa07812d89bf6ab4e","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_20_talk/","publishdate":"2023-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_20_talk/","section":"post","summary":"A talk was given to the Texas A\u0026amp;M University, College Station, TX, on \u0026ldquo;Decarbonization of Building and Urban Energy Systems: A Multiscale Data-driven Approach\u0026rdquo;.","tags":null,"title":"June 2023 | A talk was given to the Texas A\u0026M University, College Station, TX.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Maomao Hu","Ram Rajagopal","Jacques A. de Chalendar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682380800,"objectID":"70579d2e73608e3256e1f78eef3c790b","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/publication/journal_paper/paper_15/","publishdate":"2023-04-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal_paper/paper_15/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Empirical Exploration of Zone-by-zone Energy Flexibility: a Non-intrusive Load Disaggregation Approach for Commercial Buildings","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A talk was given to the Institute of Refrigeration and Cryogenics at Zhejiang University, China on \u0026ldquo;Decarbonization of Building and Urban Energy Systems: A Multiscale Data-driven Approach\u0026rdquo;.\n","date":1679356800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679356800,"objectID":"0adada0079a97c386433d17f84e78e1c","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_19_talk/","publishdate":"2023-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_19_talk/","section":"post","summary":"A talk was given to the Institute of Refrigeration and Cryogenics at Zhejiang University, China on \u0026ldquo;Decarbonization of Building and Urban Energy Systems: A Multiscale Data-driven Approach\u0026rdquo;.","tags":null,"title":"March 2023 | A talk was given to the Institute of Refrigeration and Cryogenics at Zhejiang University, China.","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The full paper can be found here.\nWhy does Building X have higher forecast accuracy than Building Y?

However, there is lack of proper operation strategies to manage these distributed energy resources. To address this problem, a novel forecasting and flexibility-based operation strategy was proposed for the photovoltaic-battery-flexible loads (PV-battery-FL) system of a single household. Compared with the traditional maximizing self-consumption and time-of-use strategies, the proposed strategy fully harnesses the flexibility of batteries and residential flexible loads, and is more grid-friendliness to the utility grid. To assess the performance of the PV-battery-FL system under the proposed strategy, a comprehensive evaluation framework was developed considering the economic and environmental performance, PV self-consumption, zero energy potential, and impacts on the utility grid. The effectiveness of the forecasting and flexibility-based strategy was validated by case studies given various scenarios. Results indicate that the proposed strategy performs better than the maximizing self-consumption and time-of-use strategies. Especially, the average ramping index reduction ratio of the forecasting and flexibility-based strategy was improved by 105.1% and 60.9%; the maximum power fed into the utility grid was decreased by 50.3%, compared with the maximizing self-consumption and time-of-use strategies for the PV-battery-FL system. When the feed-in limitation exists, the forecasting and flexibility-based strategy can also reduce the cut-off energy significantly. This study can provide guidance for the demand-side management of the battery and flexible loads of residential PV-battery-FL systems in practice.\n","date":1675123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675123200,"objectID":"e7e5c65517060642c0016f69fb2b7084","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_17_paper/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_17_paper/","section":"post","summary":"Our recent research paper entitled \"**A novel forecast-based operation strategy for residential PV-battery-flexible loads systems considering the flexibility of battery and loads**\" was published in *Energy Conversion and Management*.","tags":null,"title":"Jan 2023 | New paper entitled \"A novel forecast-based operation strategy for residential PV-battery-flexible loads systems considering the flexibility of battery and loads\" was published in *Energy Conversion and Management*!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zhengyi Luo","Jinqing Peng","Yutong Tan","Rongxin Yin","Bin Zou","Maomao Hu","Jinyue Yan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675036800,"objectID":"bffc6dca45518539fcd105990de11117","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/publication/journal_paper/paper_13/","publishdate":"2023-01-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal_paper/paper_13/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A novel forecast-based operation strategy for residential PV-battery-flexible loads systems considering the flexibility of battery and loads","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our recent research paper entitled \u0026ldquo;Stochastic modelling of flexible load characteristics of split-type air conditioners using grey-box modelling and random forest method\u0026rdquo; was published in Energy and Buildings.\nMany thanks to Zhihao and Prof. Jinqing Peng for leading this collaboration.\nThe full paper can be found here.\nAbstract Split-type air conditioners (ACs) are the major contributors to the total electricity use and peak power demand in residential buildings due to their high penetration. Accurate prediction of their energy consumption plays a significant role in demand side management (DSM), because it can help exploit the demand response (DR) potential of these ACs fully. However, the existing studies on the load characteristics modelling of split-type ACs are still not comprehensive, especially in the consideration of occupant behavior and appliance characteristics. To solve this problem, this study has developed a novel flexible load characteristics model by combining the stochastic method, grey-box modelling (i.e., equivalent thermal parameter (ETP) model) and random forest method. The stochastic method can help capture the dynamic occupants’ energy-related behaviors considering various family structures. Random forest can address the difficulties in simulating the power characteristics of variable-speed ACs under various operating conditions. With the prediction error of 2.8%, the proposed model can effectively characterize the energy performance of split-type ACs at both individual and aggregate levels. To better show the load flexibility of ACs, an investigation on DR potential of split-type ACs was also carried out by resetting temperature setpoints. The result showed that the maximum DR potentials at the scope of 1000 aggregated households are 394.54 kWh and 323.82 kWh on weekdays and weekends, respectively. The developed flexible load characteristics model of ACs can be used by utility companies for DR potential assessment and model-based DR control for a single household or building clusters.\n","date":1660262400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660262400,"objectID":"726a2ef90f779f810adde0b92752e72e","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_16_paper/","publishdate":"2022-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_16_paper/","section":"post","summary":"Our recent research paper entitled \"**Stochastic modelling of flexible load characteristics of split-type air conditioners using grey-box modelling and random forest method**\" was published in *Energy and Buildings*.","tags":null,"title":"Aug 2022 | New paper entitled \"Stochastic modelling of flexible load characteristics of split-type air conditioners using grey-box modelling and random forest method\" was published in *Energy and Buildings*!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zhihao Jiang","Jinqing Peng","Rongxin Yin","Maomao Hu","Jingyu Cao","Bin Zou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660176000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660176000,"objectID":"3f9cc29841f11b8bd61ab64a76aeab45","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/publication/journal_paper/paper_12/","publishdate":"2022-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal_paper/paper_12/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Stochastic modelling of flexible load characteristics of split-type air conditioners using grey-box modelling and random forest method","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"ERE Seminar - Maomao Hu: \u0026ldquo;Data-driven Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive Analytics of Building and Urban Energy Systems\u0026rdquo;\n  WHEN: Monday, March 7 2022, 12:15 pm\n  SPONSOR:Energy Resources Engineering\n  Abstract Today’s building and urban energy systems are not only energy-intensive but also data-intensive due to the advances in information and communications technology. How can we extract actionable information and knowledge from large volumes of operational data using advanced data analytics? More importantly, how can the extracted information be further used for data-driven modelling (grey/black-box) and advanced model-based control to make building and urban energy systems low-carbon, energy-efficient, energy-flexible, and resilient against climate-induced extreme weather events? This talk aims to unpack these questions and spark reflection on the topic of data analytics-based techniques for building and urban energy systems.\nBio Dr. Maomao Hu is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Energy Resources Engineering at Stanford University since November 2021. Prior to joining Stanford, he was a postdoc in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford for two years. He received his PhD degree in Building Environment and Energy Engineering from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2019. In 2018, he studied as a guest PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark. His research interests include data analytics, data-driven modelling, numerical optimization, and model predictive control of the building and urban energy systems for GHG emission reduction, energy efficiency, energy flexibility, and energy resiliency. He has been actively contributing to international collaborations, including the ongoing IEA EBC Annex 81 (Data-Driven Smart Buildings) and Annex 82 (Energy Flexible Buildings Towards Resilient Low Carbon Energy Systems).\n","date":1646611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646611200,"objectID":"2b98b280f7b97607d5e18ec16b83bfee","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_15/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_15/","section":"post","summary":"Maomao Hu was invited of a talk at ERE Graduate Seminar.","tags":null,"title":"Mar 2022 | A talk was given at ERE Graduate Seminar at Stanford.","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Maomao Hu was profiled by the 85th Anniversary Special Issue of PolyU Excel x Impact Magazine.\n","date":1645142400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645142400,"objectID":"f7dfbd91422a40becae1604f9db4b4a2","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_14/","publishdate":"2022-02-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_14/","section":"post","summary":"Maomao Hu was recently profiled by the **85th Anniversary Special Issue of PolyU Excel x Impact Magazine**.","tags":null,"title":"Feb 2022 | Maomao Hu was profiled by the 85th Anniversary Special Issue of PolyU Excel x Impact Magazine.","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our recent research paper entitled \u0026ldquo;Probabilistic electrical load forecasting for buildings using Bayesian deep neural networks\u0026rdquo; was published in Journal of Building Engineering.\nMany thanks to Dr. Lei Xu for leading this collaboration.\nThe full paper can be found here.\nAbstract Deep learning techniques are increasingly applied in building electrical load analysis thanks to the enrichment of information-intensive sensory data. However, uncertainty is seldom considered among existing deep learning models. This study proposes three Bayesian deep neural network models for probabilistic building electrical load forecasting. Three prevalent deep neural networks (recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU)) are utilized for model development. In each model, the dropout technique is implemented as a variational Bayesian approximation to quantify two types of model uncertainties: aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Performances of the proposed models are evaluated using real data. The results showed that all the proposed three models achieved satisfactory performances and the Bayesian LSTM (BLSTM) model achieved the best performance with up to 15.4% mean absolute percentage error reduction than the baseline model. It was also found that the weather variables were not necessary inputs for Bayesian deep neural network models. The impacts of the input time lags and forecasting horizons on load forecasting accuracies were also investigated. It was found that the BLSTM model could derive decent model performances with only 10 h lagged electrical loads and achieve satisfactory accuracies for the 1-day ahead load forecasting.\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"e25afc5276ed6e6a2f37f4a84d4eaf96","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_13/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_13/","section":"post","summary":"Our recent research paper entitled \"**Probabilistic electrical load forecasting for buildings using Bayesian deep neural networks**\" was published in *Journal of Building Engineering*.","tags":null,"title":"Jan 2022 | Our new paper entitled \"Probabilistic electrical load forecasting for buildings using Bayesian deep neural networks\" was published in *Journal of Building Engineering*!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Lei Xu","Maomao Hu","Cheng Fan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"9ff6e6c0339f55bfc8e950bc2a5eec10","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/publication/journal_paper/paper_11/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal_paper/paper_11/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Probabilistic electrical load forecasting for buildings using Bayesian deep neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1637539200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637539200,"objectID":"2e2a2433229abbce4438e8143e62162c","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/project/4_cooler/","publishdate":"2021-11-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/4_cooler/","section":"project","summary":"To enable low-carbon, electrified community energy systems using Stanford campus as a real-life testbed.","tags":["Building clusters","Data Analytics","Data-driven Modelling","Demand Response","Energy flexibility","Uncertainty","Building Energy System"],"title":"COOLER at Stanford","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"After 2ish years at the University of Oxford as a postdoc, I’m excited to share that I am joining Stanford University this week as a postdoc for the COOLER project, whose goal is to enable low-carbon, electrified district energy systems using Stanford campus as a real-life testbed.\nI would like to thank Prof. David Wallom and other group members at Oxford for truly allowing me to grow and helping me flourish in my role.

For a distribution network with embedded photovoltaic (PV) systems, it is also desirable to enumerate these premises since unreported PV installations can have a detrimental impact on voltage control, frequency regulation, and incur reverse power flows. In this paper, a holistic smart meter data analytics approach is proposed for classifying and characterizing the intra-day load curves of PV and non-PV households. Unlike existing studies based on raw time-series data, a series of interpretable and discriminating global and peak-period features are first developed to extract the physical information of load patterns. A two-step feature-based clustering is then applied to classify the load profiles of PV and non-PV households. A post-clustering quantitative compositional analysis is developed to characterize the energy use variability and compositional changes for each household. The proposed PV household identification method allows network owners to identify the existence of PV installations in a particular area for voltage control and ancillary service provision. In the longer term, effective load pattern categorization and post-clustering characterization can help better understand demand characteristics of different cohorts of customers, network utilization, and network-level changes in load growth.\n","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"c84b3c49d6ec1cbac71a027550a295db","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_11/","publishdate":"2021-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_11/","section":"post","summary":"Our recent research paper entitled \"**Classification and characterization of intra-day load curves of PV and non-PV households using interpretable feature extraction and feature-based clustering**\" was published in *Sustainable Cities and Society*.","tags":null,"title":"Oct 2021 | Our new paper entitled \"Classification and characterization of intra-day load curves of PV and non-PV households using interpretable feature extraction and feature-based clustering\" was published in *Sustainable Cities and Society*!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Maomao Hu","Dongjiao Ge","Rory Telford","Bruce Stephen","David C.H.

The extracted features can be applied for further feature-based machine learning purposes, including feature-based PCA, clustering, classification, and regression.\n(2) Two PY files (.py) are included in the IFEEL package, including ifeel_transformation.py and ifeel_extraction.py.\n(3) Two types of features, including 13 global features (GFs) and 8 peak-period features (PFs), can be extracted by using this package. Detailed description of all features can be found in Ref [1] or the Demo file in the installed IFEEL package.\n(4) GFs are extracted based on raw time-series data, while PFs are extracted based on symbolic representation of time series data. GFs and PFs can be obtained by using IFEEL.ifeel_extraction.feature_global and IFEEL.ifeel_extraction.feature_peak_period, respectively.\n(5) For fast peak-period feature extraction, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) representation is first used to transform the time-series numerical patterns into alphabetical words. The feature transformation process is performed by calling IFEEL.ifeel_transformation.feature_transformation. More details about SAX approach can be found in Ref [2] and Ref [3].\n🔈 Notes  (1) To successfully run the IFEEL, the following Python data analysis libraries need to be installed in advance: Numpy, Scipy, and Pandas.\n(2) A Demo can be found in the installed IFEEL package or here. Three datasets at different time intervals can be downloaded here, and tested in the Demo.\n(3) The Demo has been tested on Python 3.7.7.\n📚 References  [1] Hu M, Ge D, Telford R, Stephen B, Wallom D.

In recent years, the data-driven approach based on machine learning algorithms has been widely adopted for building energy prediction due to the availability of massive data in building automation systems (BASs), which automatically collect and store real-time building operational data. For new buildings and most existing buildings without installing advanced BASs, there is a lack of sufficient data to train data-driven predictive models. Transfer learning is a promising method to develop accurate and reliable data-driven building energy prediction models with limited training data by taking advantage of the rich data/knowledge obtained from other buildings. Few studies focused on the influences of source building datasets, pre-training data volume, and training data volume on the performance of the transfer learning method. The present study aims to develop a transfer learning-based ANN model for one-hour ahead building energy prediction to fill this research gap. Around 400 non-residential buildings’ data from the open-source Building Genome Project are used to test the proposed method. Extensive analysis demonstrates that transfer learning can effectively improve the accuracy of BPNN-based building energy models for information-poor buildings with very limited training data. The most influential building features which influence the effectiveness of transfer learning are found to be building usage and industry. The research outcomes can provide guidance for implementation of transfer learning, especially in selecting appropriate source buildings and datasets for developing accurate building energy prediction models.\n","date":1599782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599782400,"objectID":"9c1211d2092a6300d5891758048d4803","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_2/","publishdate":"2020-09-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_2/","section":"post","summary":"Our recent research paper entitled \"**Development of an ANN-based Building Energy Model for Information-poor Buildings Using Transfer Learning**\" was published in *Building Simulation*.","tags":null,"title":"Sep 2020 | Our new paper entitled \"Development of an ANN-based Building Energy Model for Information-poor Buildings Using Transfer Learning\" was published in *Building Simulation*!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our recent review article entitled  Neighborhood-level coordination and negotiation techniques for managing demand-side flexibility in residential microgrids was published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. Glad to see my last piece of work at PolyU coming out.\nAbstract The management of demand-side flexibility plays a key role in reliable integration of intermittent renewable energy sources into residential microgrids. Residential microgrid is a dynamic and complex cyber-physical system, which consists of multiple cooperative, non-cooperative and even conflicting entities. Random and separate demand-side management of the multiple entities may have detrimental effects on the grid reliability like the peak “rebound” issue and on the economic benefits for both utilities and consumers. Harmonized coordination, not merely unorganized cooperation, among cooperative entities and negotiation among non-cooperative entities based on information sharing are therefore needed to achieve the neighborhood-level optimal solutions in a residential microgrid. This paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-the-art classification, technologies, architectures, and techniques for neighborhood-level coordination and negotiation in residential microgrids. Various types of coordination and negotiation behaviors are first categorized. The technologies, i.e., demand-side flexible resources involved in coordination and negotiation, are then summarized and introduced, including flexible loads, storage, and distributed generations. The typical architectures for coordination and negotiation are then classified into centralized, decentralized, hierarchical distributed, and non-hierarchical distributed architecture. Last, the major coordination and negotiation techniques, including multi-agent system, optimization and game theory, are reviewed and summarized. The challenges and opportunities for each technique are identified and critically discussed.\n","date":1598313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598313600,"objectID":"d73b2c4f36e77d25b672b82137eb9c91","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_1/","publishdate":"2020-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_1/","section":"post","summary":"Our recent review article entitled \"**Neighborhood-level Coordination and Negotiation Techniques for Managing Demand-side Flexibility in Residential Microgrids**\" was published in *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews*.

Fig. Uncertainty-based energy flexibility: hourly uncertainty-based energy flexibility for building clusters of various scales: (a) 8 households, (b) 80 households, (c) 320 households, and (d) 5120 households.   About\nModern buildings are expected to be not only energy efficient but also energy flexible to facilitate reliable integration of intermittent renewable energy sources into smart grids. Estimating the aggregate energy-flexibility potential at a cluster level plays a key role in assessing financial benefits and service area for energy-flexibility services at design stage and determining real-time pricings at operating stage. However, most existing studies focused on the energy flexibility of individual buildings rather than building clusters. In addition, due to the intrinsic uncertainty in building envelope parameters, performance of building energy systems, and occupancy and occupant behavior, it is necessary to quantify the uncertainty in aggregate energy flexibility.\nIn this study, we developed an approach to quantifying the uncertainty in the aggregate energy flexibility of residential building clusters using a data-driven stochastic occupancy model that can capture the stochasticity of occupancy patterns. A questionnaire survey was carried out to collect occupancy time-series data in Hong Kong for occupancy model identification. Aggregation analysis was conducted considering various building archetypes and occupancy patterns. The uncertainty in aggregate energy flexibility was then quantified based on the proposed performance indices using Monte Carlo technique.\nWith the scaling up of building clusters, the estimated energy-flexibility potential became steady and the weekly energy flexibility stayed around 12.40%. However, the weekly uncertainty of aggregated energy flexibility exponentially decreased from 19.12% for 8 households to 0.74% for 5,120 households, which means that the estimate of a building cluster’s energy flexibility is more reliable than that of a single building.\n Related Publication\n Maomao Hu, Fu Xiao (2020).

Existing demand response control strategies for residential air conditioners focus on single-speed type and mainly adopt temperature set point reset to respond to hourly day-ahead electricity prices. This study represents the first attempt to directly control the operating frequency of inverter air conditioners in response to high-granularity electricity price signals, i.e., 5-minute real-time electricity prices, using model predictive control method.\nA simplified room thermal model in the stochastic state-space representation and performance maps of an inverter air conditioner are developed and integrated for predicting the coupled thermal response of an air-conditioned room. A demand response-enabled model predictive controller is designed based on the coupled model to optimally control the operating frequency of the inverter air conditioner while taking account of all the influential variables including weather conditions, occupancy, and 5-min real-time electricity prices. A Kalman filter is adopted to estimate the unmeasurable variables and remove the noises in measurements. A TRNSYS-MATLAB co-simulation testbed is developed to test the thermal and energy performances of the model predictive controller.\nResults show that compared to the PID controller, the demand response-enabled model predictive controller can implement automatic and optimal precooling to improve occupant’s thermal comfort at the beginning of occupancy. Moreover, it can also reduce average power consumption during peak demand periods by 17.31% to 38.86% compared with the PID controller and reduce all-day electricity costs by 0.42% to 22.16%. The frequency-based model predictive control method enables residential inverter air conditioners to be more grid-friendly and cost-efficient.\n Related Publication\n Maomao Hu, Fu Xiao, John Bagterp Jørgensen, Shengwei Wang (2019).

About\nFloor heating (FH) system is a widely-used thermally active building system, which can take advantage of building thermal mass to shift energy demands to off-peak hours. Its ability of effective utilization of low-temperature energy resources also helps to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, control of FH systems remains a challenge due to the large thermal inertia of the pipe-embedded concrete floor. In the context of smart grids, the control issue becomes more complicated because the dynamic electricity prices need to be taken into consideration to achieve economic benefits and encourage demand response participation.\nIn this study, an advanced optimal control method, i.e., model predictive control (MPC), is developed for FH systems, which can simultaneously consider all the influential variables including weather conditions, occupancy and dynamic electricity prices. Considering the on-line computational efficiency, a control-oriented dynamic thermal model for a room integrated with FH system is developed and represented in a stochastic state-space form. An economic MPC controller, formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, is designed for FH systems. A TRNSYS-MATLAB co-simulation testbed is developed to test and compare different control methods under various operating conditions in terms of energy consumption, thermal comfort and operating costs.\nTest results show that, compared to the conventional on-off controller, the MPC controller is able to use building thermal mass to optimally shift energy consumption to low-price periods, improve thermal comfort at the beginning of occupancy, reduce energy demand during peak periods, and save electricity costs for residential end-users. The weather conditions and electricity prices have influences on the start-up time and duration of preheating, energy flexibility potential and electricity cost savings of FH systems.\n Acknowledgement\nThe presented work receives the support of the CITIES project, the SCA project, and the EnergyLab Nordhavn project in Denmark.\n Related Publication\n Maomao Hu, Fu Xiao, John Bagterp Jørgensen, Rongling Li (2019).
