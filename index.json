The extracted features can be applied for further feature-based machine learning purposes, including feature-based PCA, clustering, classification, and regression.\n(2) Two PY files (.py) are included in the IFEEL package, including ifeel_transformation.py and ifeel_extraction.py.\n(3) Two types of features, including 13 global features (GFs) and 8 peak-period features (PFs), can be extracted by using this package. Detailed description of all features can be found in Ref [1] or the Demo file in the installed IFEEL package.\n(4) GFs are extracted based on raw time-series data, while PFs are extracted based on symbolic representation of time series data. GFs and PFs can be obtained by using IFEEL.ifeel_extraction.feature_global and IFEEL.ifeel_extraction.feature_peak_period, respectively.\n(5) For fast peak-period feature extraction, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) representation is first used to transform the time-series numerical patterns into alphabetical words. The feature transformation process is performed by calling IFEEL.ifeel_transformation.feature_transformation. More details about SAX approach can be found in Ref [2] and Ref [3].\nüîà Notes  (1) To successfully run the IFEEL, the following Python data analysis libraries need to be installed in advance: Numpy, Scipy, and Pandas.\n(2) A Demo can be found in the installed IFEEL package or here.

In recent years, the data-driven approach based on machine learning algorithms has been widely adopted for building energy prediction due to the availability of massive data in building automation systems (BASs), which automatically collect and store real-time building operational data. For new buildings and most existing buildings without installing advanced BASs, there is a lack of sufficient data to train data-driven predictive models. Transfer learning is a promising method to develop accurate and reliable data-driven building energy prediction models with limited training data by taking advantage of the rich data/knowledge obtained from other buildings. Few studies focused on the influences of source building datasets, pre-training data volume, and training data volume on the performance of the transfer learning method. The present study aims to develop a transfer learning-based ANN model for one-hour ahead building energy prediction to fill this research gap. Around 400 non-residential buildings‚Äô data from the open-source Building Genome Project are used to test the proposed method. Extensive analysis demonstrates that transfer learning can effectively improve the accuracy of BPNN-based building energy models for information-poor buildings with very limited training data. The most influential building features which influence the effectiveness of transfer learning are found to be building usage and industry. The research outcomes can provide guidance for implementation of transfer learning, especially in selecting appropriate source buildings and datasets for developing accurate building energy prediction models.\n","date":1599782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599782400,"objectID":"9c1211d2092a6300d5891758048d4803","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_2/","publishdate":"2020-09-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_2/","section":"post","summary":"Our recent research paper entitled \"**Development of an ANN-based Building Energy Model for Information-poor Buildings Using Transfer Learning**\" was published in *Building Simulation*.","tags":null,"title":"Sep 2020 | Our new paper entitled \"Development of an ANN-based Building Energy Model for Information-poor Buildings Using Transfer Learning\" was published in *Building Simulation*!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our recent review article entitled  Neighborhood-level coordination and negotiation techniques for managing demand-side flexibility in residential microgrids was published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. Glad to see my last piece of work at PolyU coming out.\nAbstract The management of demand-side flexibility plays a key role in reliable integration of intermittent renewable energy sources into residential microgrids. Residential microgrid is a dynamic and complex cyber-physical system, which consists of multiple cooperative, non-cooperative and even conflicting entities. Random and separate demand-side management of the multiple entities may have detrimental effects on the grid reliability like the peak ‚Äúrebound‚Äù issue and on the economic benefits for both utilities and consumers. Harmonized coordination, not merely unorganized cooperation, among cooperative entities and negotiation among non-cooperative entities based on information sharing are therefore needed to achieve the neighborhood-level optimal solutions in a residential microgrid. This paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-the-art classification, technologies, architectures, and techniques for neighborhood-level coordination and negotiation in residential microgrids. Various types of coordination and negotiation behaviors are first categorized. The technologies, i.e., demand-side flexible resources involved in coordination and negotiation, are then summarized and introduced, including flexible loads, storage, and distributed generations. The typical architectures for coordination and negotiation are then classified into centralized, decentralized, hierarchical distributed, and non-hierarchical distributed architecture. Last, the major coordination and negotiation techniques, including multi-agent system, optimization and game theory, are reviewed and summarized. The challenges and opportunities for each technique are identified and critically discussed.\n","date":1598313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598313600,"objectID":"d73b2c4f36e77d25b672b82137eb9c91","permalink":"https://maomaohu.net/post/post_1/","publishdate":"2020-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_1/","section":"post","summary":"Our recent review article entitled \"**Neighborhood-level Coordination and Negotiation Techniques for Managing Demand-side Flexibility in Residential Microgrids**\" was published in *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews*.

Fig. Uncertainty-based energy flexibility: hourly uncertainty-based energy flexibility for building clusters of various scales: (a) 8 households, (b) 80 households, (c) 320 households, and (d) 5120 households.   About\nModern buildings are expected to be not only energy efficient but also energy flexible to facilitate reliable integration of intermittent renewable energy sources into smart grids. Estimating the aggregate energy-flexibility potential at a cluster level plays a key role in assessing financial benefits and service area for energy-flexibility services at design stage and determining real-time pricings at operating stage. However, most existing studies focused on the energy flexibility of individual buildings rather than building clusters. In addition, due to the intrinsic uncertainty in building envelope parameters, performance of building energy systems, and occupancy and occupant behavior, it is necessary to quantify the uncertainty in aggregate energy flexibility.\nIn this study, we developed an approach to quantifying the uncertainty in the aggregate energy flexibility of residential building clusters using a data-driven stochastic occupancy model that can capture the stochasticity of occupancy patterns. A questionnaire survey was carried out to collect occupancy time-series data in Hong Kong for occupancy model identification. Aggregation analysis was conducted considering various building archetypes and occupancy patterns. The uncertainty in aggregate energy flexibility was then quantified based on the proposed performance indices using Monte Carlo technique.\nWith the scaling up of building clusters, the estimated energy-flexibility potential became steady and the weekly energy flexibility stayed around 12.40%. However, the weekly uncertainty of aggregated energy flexibility exponentially decreased from 19.12% for 8 households to 0.74% for 5,120 households, which means that the estimate of a building cluster‚Äôs energy flexibility is more reliable than that of a single building. \n Related Publication\n Maomao Hu, Fu Xiao (2020).

Existing demand response control strategies for residential air conditioners focus on single-speed type and mainly adopt temperature set point reset to respond to hourly day-ahead electricity prices. This study represents the first attempt to directly control the operating frequency of inverter air conditioners in response to high-granularity electricity price signals, i.e., 5-minute real-time electricity prices, using model predictive control method.\nA simplified room thermal model in the stochastic state-space representation and performance maps of an inverter air conditioner are developed and integrated for predicting the coupled thermal response of an air-conditioned room. A demand response-enabled model predictive controller is designed based on the coupled model to optimally control the operating frequency of the inverter air conditioner while taking account of all the influential variables including weather conditions, occupancy, and 5-min real-time electricity prices. A Kalman filter is adopted to estimate the unmeasurable variables and remove the noises in measurements. A TRNSYS-MATLAB co-simulation testbed is developed to test the thermal and energy performances of the model predictive controller.\nResults show that compared to the PID controller, the demand response-enabled model predictive controller can implement automatic and optimal precooling to improve occupant‚Äôs thermal comfort at the beginning of occupancy. Moreover, it can also reduce average power consumption during peak demand periods by 17.31% to 38.86% compared with the PID controller and reduce all-day electricity costs by 0.42% to 22.16%. The frequency-based model predictive control method enables residential inverter air conditioners to be more grid-friendly and cost-efficient.\n Related Publication\n Maomao Hu, Fu Xiao, John Bagterp J√∏rgensen, Shengwei Wang (2019).

About\nFloor heating (FH) system is a widely-used thermally active building system, which can take advantage of building thermal mass to shift energy demands to off-peak hours. Its ability of effective utilization of low-temperature energy resources also helps to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, control of FH systems remains a challenge due to the large thermal inertia of the pipe-embedded concrete floor. In the context of smart grids, the control issue becomes more complicated because the dynamic electricity prices need to be taken into consideration to achieve economic benefits and encourage demand response participation.\nIn this study, an advanced optimal control method, i.e., model predictive control (MPC), is developed for FH systems, which can simultaneously consider all the influential variables including weather conditions, occupancy and dynamic electricity prices. Considering the on-line computational efficiency, a control-oriented dynamic thermal model for a room integrated with FH system is developed and represented in a stochastic state-space form. An economic MPC controller, formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, is designed for FH systems. A TRNSYS-MATLAB co-simulation testbed is developed to test and compare different control methods under various operating conditions in terms of energy consumption, thermal comfort and operating costs.\nTest results show that, compared to the conventional on-off controller, the MPC controller is able to use building thermal mass to optimally shift energy consumption to low-price periods, improve thermal comfort at the beginning of occupancy, reduce energy demand during peak periods, and save electricity costs for residential end-users. The weather conditions and electricity prices have influences on the start-up time and duration of preheating, energy flexibility potential and electricity cost savings of FH systems.¬†\n Acknowledgement\nThe presented work receives the support of the CITIES project, the SCA project, and the EnergyLab Nordhavn project in Denmark.\n Related Publication\n Maomao Hu, Fu Xiao, John Bagterp J√∏rgensen, Rongling Li (2019).
